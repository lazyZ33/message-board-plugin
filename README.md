This plugin adds a repositionable message board widget directly to the WordPress Dashboard. It’s perfect for internal team notes, reminders, and site development documentation that admins need to see immediately upon login.

Features:
The widget provides essential tools for internal communication:

* Dashboard Widget: Fully collapsible and draggable on the main admin screen.
* Note Creation: Quickly create plain text notes (supports links) with a title and date.
* Visibility Control: Set notes to be visible to All Admins or restrict visibility to specific individual users.
* Note Management: Only the creator can edit or delete their own notes. The widget defaults to the "Create New Note" screen.
* Archive View: Browse and open all existing notes, organized by date.

Usage:

* Activation: Once activated, find the Message Board widget on your main Dashboard screen.
* Creating: Use the default view to quickly draft a note and set its visibility.
* Viewing: Click "All Notes" to browse the archive. Select a note to view its full content, author, and date.

Requirements:

* WordPress 5.0 or higher.
* A user role with dashboard access (typically Administrator or Editor).
